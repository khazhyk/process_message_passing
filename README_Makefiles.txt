In order to use the makefiles, the main makefile allows you to do a make and a make clean for one or both of the parts.
Within the LKM directory, you can also load or unload the kernel module.
Within the Test directory, you can also run tests from the makefile, but this sometimes results in problems, so it is not recommended.
